Title: Tests for HDF5-backed DNAme, RNAseq, and MultiAssayExperiment objects
Description: This package is meant as a minimal reproducible example for several issues with HDF5-backed objects in practical usage, as with complex experiments that combine bulk and single-cell of multiple types from multiple samples, not always uniformly across samples, timepoints, assays, or cellular resolution. Additional hooks for SQLDataFrame and/or restfulSE testing will be added over time.
